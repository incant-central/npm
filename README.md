# Git ShellSpec Definition

This is a work-in-progress. It is an attempt to comprehensively define the git command in [ShellSpec](https://github.com/machellerogden/shellspec). I'm doing this exercise mostly in order to suss out edge cases in ShellSpec and to help refine it's specification to ensure it's usefulness and viability.

### Initial definition to include:

[x] config
[x] help
[x] init
[x] clone
[x] add
[x] status
[x] diff
[x] commit
[x] branch
[x] checkout
[ ] merge
[ ] log
[ ] stash
[ ] tag
[ ] fetch
[ ] pull
[ ] push
[ ] remote
[ ] apply
[ ] cherry-pick
[ ] rebase
[ ] revert
[ ] blame
[ ] grep
[ ] rev-parse
